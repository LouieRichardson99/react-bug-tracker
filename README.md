## The Front-end Explained

The front-end uses React for it's user interface because of speed, and the capabilty to efficiently populate, and update components with new data from the MySQL database.

### Styling

In terms of styling, there are many great ways to style React apps, but my chosen method for this web application is [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com). My reasoning behind this is pretty simple, CSS-in-JS rocks!

Being able to combine JSX, CSS, and JavaScript all in one component makes maintaining and building components a whole lot nicer.
